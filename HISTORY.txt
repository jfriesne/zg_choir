v1.01 -
   - Added code to test_peer.cpp to test sending and receiving of
     user-level Messages via unicast and multicast.
   - Added multicast-behavior setting to the ZGPeerSettings class
     to allow control of what sort of multicast packets should go over
     Wi-Fi and non-Wifi network interfaces, respectively.
   * Merged in changes from Ruurd Adema to make
     MessageReceivedFromPeer() protected instead of private.
