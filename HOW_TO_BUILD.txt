Quick instructions on how to compile this software, in case you care to do so.

To compile the ZGChoir GUI demo app under MacOS/X, Windows, or Linux:

1) Make sure you have a reasonably modern C++ compiler installed
2) Make sure you have a reasonably recent version of Qt installed (I use Qt 5.9.0; other Qt 5.x versions will probably work too but YMMV)
3) cd to the zg/demos/choir sub-directory
4) Run "qmake"
5) Under Windows, then run "nmake"; under MacOS/X or Linux, run "make"
6) Wait a few minutes for the application to build
7) When it's done building, the executable will be named ZGChoir.app under MacOS/X, ZGChoir under Linux, or Release\ZGChoir.exe under Windows

To compile the test_peer command-line app under MacOS/X or Linux:

1) Make sure you have a reasonably modern C++ compiler installed
2) cd to the zg/tests folder
3) Run "make"
4) Wait a minute for the test_peer program to build
5) When it's done building, you can run it with no arguments, like this:  ./test_peer

That's all there is to it!
